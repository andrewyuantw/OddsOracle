Chrome extension to show stats when browsing Fanduel NBA sports lines

# Vision
University of Maryland had extensions where as you were browsing courses, the professor's RateMyProfessor ratings would be injected on the page.
The vision is to inject player stats and other helpful information as you are browsing FanDuel lines.

#### Sample use case:
Line is LeBron o/u 17 points, I want a popover telling me what LeBron's current season ppg average is, how many times in the past 10 games LeBron has covered this line, any notable injuries from each team, etc.

NOTE: Originally wanted to do TamperMonkey script, ESPN requests get CSP-ed on FanDuel so switching to chrome extension instead
